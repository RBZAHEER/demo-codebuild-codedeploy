### 1. **Ensure Nginx Uses Your Custom `index.html`**
   By default, Nginx serves the `index.html` located in `/usr/share/nginx/html/`. If you're still seeing the Nginx welcome page, it's possible that Nginx isn't properly serving your custom `index.html`.

   **Fix**: Ensure Nginx is serving files from the correct directory:
   - Open the Nginx default configuration file to check where the `index.html` is being served from:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
     ```
   - Look for the `location` block that serves the root directory. It should look like this:
     ```nginx
     location / {
         root /usr/share/nginx/html;
         index index.html index.htm;
     }
     ```
     If this path is correct (which it should be), Nginx will serve the `index.html` from `/usr/share/nginx/html/`.

   - **If you have modified the `index.html` or added your own custom index**, ensure that it is named correctly (`index.html`), and there are no permissions issues preventing Nginx from serving it.

### 2. **Clear Nginx Cache (If any)**
   Nginx may be serving a cached version of the page.

   **Fix**: Restart Nginx to clear any cached pages and reload the new configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### 3. **Check Nginx Configuration for Syntax Errors**
   If there is a syntax error in the Nginx configuration file, it might prevent the web server from serving your `index.html`.

   **Fix**: Check for syntax errors in the Nginx configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```
   This will tell you if there are any issues with the configuration. If everything is good, you should see:
   ```
   nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
   ```

   If there are errors, fix them and restart Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### 4. **Check Nginx Default Welcome Page**
   If your `index.html` is being overwritten or not replaced properly, the default welcome page might still be in place. You can manually check the content of `/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`:
   ```bash
   cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
   ```

   If the default welcome page is still there, something went wrong during your deployment, and the file might not have been copied correctly.

   **Fix**: Try copying the `index.html` again after confirming that it's the correct file:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /path/to/your/local/index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
   ```

### 5. **File Permissions**
   Ensure that the `index.html` file has the correct permissions and ownership for Nginx to read it.

   **Fix**: Set proper ownership and permissions on your files:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /usr/share/nginx/html
   sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/share/nginx/html
   ```

### 6. **Verify Security Groups and Port Accessibility**
   Finally, ensure that your EC2 instance's security group allows inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP).

   **Fix**: Go to your AWS console and check the security group associated with your EC2 instance. Ensure that there is an inbound rule allowing traffic on port 80 (HTTP). The rule should look something like this:
   ```
   Type: HTTP
   Protocol: TCP
   Port Range: 80
   Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (or a specific range if needed)
   ```
